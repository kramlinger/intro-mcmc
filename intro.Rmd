This is a short tutorial introducing the principles of MCMC methodology using \texttt{R} examples. 
First, we discuss the [Metropolis-Hastings algorithm](...), motivate the [Gibbs Sampler](...) 


This document gives an example on the implementation of a Gibbs sampler in a mixture model using completion. 
The data has been gathered from Ani Kannal from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data). 
It is merely a calculation example and not intended for interpretation. 
A detailed derivation and discussion of the problem is given in Robert \& Casella (2004): Monte Carlo Statistical Methods.
